This is a quick hack that uses the Youtube Data API to create playlists and subscriptions from Google Takeout for Youtube.

I wrote this to transfer my playlists and subscription from one Google account to another.

To use this, you must first 
[enable the Youtube Data API for your Google account](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/go#step_1_turn_on_the_api_name)
including downloading the credentials for oAuth.  Save the credential file as 
cs.json.
